---title: Chatslayout: pagepermalink: /chats/---We have many **special interest groups ** which share their information using WhatsApp chats and google groups. Click below to go to linked lists of these groups, and join the ones that interest you.

Some groups are open to anyone living near Berne, not just ICB members. We ask for your forename. Join the groups that interest you to find activities and to talk to others. Introduce yourself and take part when you feel like it. Be tolerant and observe conversational etiquette. Mute the group if a discussion annoys you, and come back when you find somehing interesting. If you leave the group, it's polite to say goodbye.
