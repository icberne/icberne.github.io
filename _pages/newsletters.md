The ICB Newsletter is the main communication channel for the club. It is a paper document (remember that old stuff?). 

We send it to members and some organisations in Berne. We send it to "prospective members", **those who have told us they are interested in the club and have given us their email and postal addresses**. We do this for just two or three editions, enough time for them to become interested in the club and attend activities and make a decision to join the club or not. 

If you are interested in joining the club, check the page [here](/join/).

Some of our old Newsletters can be found in [blog posts](/category/club/newsletters/).
