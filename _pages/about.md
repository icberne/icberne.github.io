The International Club of Bern (ICB) was founded in 1991: a non-political association open to all people who are interested in meeting others for social, sporting and cultural activities. We have activities exploring all aspects of  life in Switzerland.

Note : Bern is the German and English name for the city, Berne is the French name,  and Berna is the Italian and Romansh name.

We have members from all over the world. Our common language is English. The club currently has members from over 30 countries and six continents. Some are born Swiss or naturalized Swiss citizens.&nbsp;

We welcome all new members for the opportunity to meet and make new friends. Our newsletter is published every two months provides information of events and activities. If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact us. 

The statutes of the club are in the [By-Laws](https://icberne.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/bylaws-g2.pdf). Our General Meetings are conducted according to [Roberts Rules](https://icberne.files.wordpress.com/2023/04/rr_simple.pdf), as simply as possible.
